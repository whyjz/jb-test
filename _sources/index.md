## Content of this Jupyter Book

1. Workflow for generating Figures 3, 4, and other supplementary figures
2. Workflow for generating Figure 5
3. Workflow for generating Figure 6 and the relevant data analysis
4. Workflow for generating Figure 7 and other supplementary figures

## Introduction

This supporting material provides ALL the workflows used in the study, including data retrieval, data ingest, analysis, and result visualization. The workflows are compiled based on their relevance to each Figure. Besides the static Jupyter Book pages, users can open a Binder session via the rocket-icon link found on each workflow page and execute the code with full reproducibility of the work presented in the study.

## Figures 1 and 2

Figures 1 and 2 are made using QGIS with the assist of the QGreenland package (glacier labels) and the Randolph Glacier Inventory version 6.0 (RGI6.0; glacier outlines). The other data necessary for the maps, including ITS_LIVE glacier speeds and flowline data, are available on the Github and Zenodo repositories. See the workflows of Figures 3, 4, and 7 for how to get them.
