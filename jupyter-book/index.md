## Content of this Jupyter Book

1. Workflow for generating Figure 3, 4, and other supplementary figures
2. Workflow for generating Figure 5
3. Workflow for generating Figure 6
4. Workflow for generating Figure 7 and other supplementary figures

## Introduction

This supporting material provides ALL the workflows used in the sutdy, including data retrieval, data ingest, analysis, and result visualization. The workflows are complied based on their relevance to each Figure. Besides the static Jupyter Book pages, You can use the Binder link and open a live code session for each workflow, which will give you full reproducibility of the work presented in the study.
