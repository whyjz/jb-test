    '''
    Apply Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter to glacier speed (u), surface elevation (elev), and surface elevations (bed) 
    along a flowline, and calculate smoothed surface elevation (elev_sm), bed elevation (bed_sm), 
    speed (u_sm), ice thickness (h_sm), speed derivative to distance (dudx_sm), 
    thickness derivate to distance (dhdx_sm), surface slope (alpha_sm),
    second derivative of thickness to distance (d2hdx2), and surface slope derivate to distance (dalphadx_sm).
    
    Arguments:
    - u:    1-D numpy array with a size of N
    - elev: 1-D numpy array with a size of N
    - bed:  1-D numpy array with a size of N
    - w: see window_length argument in savgol_filter. 
    - delta: delta in savgol_filter. 
    - mode: mode in savgol_filter. 
    
    Returns:
    - all returns are a 1-D numpy array with a size of N
